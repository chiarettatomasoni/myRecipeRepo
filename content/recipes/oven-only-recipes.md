## Miso-roasted aubergines with roasted veg and butterbeans (GF/VEGAN/DF)

serves 3-4

Ingredients:

* 2 large aubergines
* 2 tablespoons miso paste
* 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup - or sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 small bag of cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 broccoli, cut into small florets
* 250g cooked Rice vermicelli noodles (they just need boiling water poured on them and they cook in a couple of minutes - check packet instructions!) 

Optional:

* sesame seeds to sprinkle on top

Notes: you can add all sorts of vegetables to the tray - remember they should cook in 20-30 minutes so if using things that take longer i.e. squash/potatoes, chop them up into 1cm pieces.


1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius.

2. Cut the aubergines in half top to bottom, score them with a knife in a criss-cross pattern, about 1cm deep, being careful not to cut the whole way through, and lay them on a baking tray cut-side up.

3. In a small bowl/mug, dissolve the miso paste and spices into 4 tablespoons of hot water and add your sweetener of choice. The mix should be runny but not watery. Spread half of this mix on the aubergines. 

4. Add the tomatoes, broccoli and buttereans to the tray around he aubergines.

5. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until you can easily pierce through the aubergine with a knife. Remove from the oven, glaze with the remaining miso mix and serve with the vermicelli noodles.

Chiara's hot tip: save a bit of the glaze mix (or make a bit extra) and stir it through the noodles to seasone them, or just season them with soy sauce.

* tortilla chips
* shredded cheese 
* guacamole
* salsa
* refried beans
* black beans
* fresh herbs

if you don't know how to make nachos, sorry but you're a loser

Chiara's hot tip: don't pile up all the toppings on just the top layer of nachos - Do a thin layer of nachos, then toppings, then another layer of nachos, then toppings, etc... so you get cheesy saucy goodness in each bite.

* toppings of your choice i.e. mushrooms, olives, anything you like JUST DON'T YOU DARE USE PINEAPPLE OR I WILL COME AND I WILL FIND YOU

if you don't know how to make pizza, sorry but you're a loser

Chiara's hot tip: preheat the baking tray first, then flour the pizza dough and add it to the tray and add your toppings - leave the crust a bit thicker if you like.

Cook this on the highest heat possible for around 7 minutes - the bottom of the crust should have taken on some colour
