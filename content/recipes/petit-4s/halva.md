Ingredients:

* 200g honey - would be good to try with golden syrup!
* 200g tahini
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* 50g whole almonds, well toasted (can also use sesame, hazelnuts, walnuts)
* pinch of salt

nice flavour combos:
cinnamon and orange zest
cardamom and lemon
sea salt w/ flaky sea salt sprinkled on top


___

1. Heat up the honey in a pan until it reaches 115 degrees celsius - should be golden and bubbly
2. Line a tray with parchment.
2. Remove from the heat and add to the tahini with the nuts and spices.
4. Chill - best if left to chill overnight as the sandy texture develops better.
