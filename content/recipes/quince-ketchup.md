Makes ~ 1 litre

Notes: you will need a high-power blender to obtain a really smooth ketchup - some immersion blenders aka stick blenders are powerful enough to do this too.

This recipe also works well with rhubarb, tomatoes, beetroot, unripe pears, carrots, parsnips, green tomatoes (adjust sugar accordingly). The runnyness will vary depending of fruit/veg used.

This ketchup can also be fermented to develop an extra funky flavour and prolong shelf-life. Let ferment at room temperature for around three days, tasting daily. Only tricky bit is mould prevention: cover the surface of the ketchup with a vine leaf and top up with 3% brine or sprinkle some salt on top. Works best if ketchup is slightly thicker so leaves don't drown.

___

Ingredients:

* 50g rapeseed oil or a neutral-tasting oil i.e. sunflower, plus 2 more tablespoons for blending
* 3 brown onions, peeled and chopped 
* 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1 kg quince - peeled, seeds removed and chopped into 1 cm pieces
* 80g soft light brown sugar
* 180g apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* pinch chilli flakes or cayenne pepper (optional)
___

1. Heat up the oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat, then add the onion and sweat it for 5 minutes whilst stirring. Then add in the cumin seeds, fennel seeds and the garlic and fry for a further 8 minutes or until you can really smell the fragrance of the seeds.

2. Add in the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to low and simmer this mixture, stirring it often, until the quince becomes very soft and can easily be broken apart with a wooden spoon. 

3. Blend in batches until really smooth, slowly drizzling in enough rapeseed oil to emulsify the mix and make it really smooth, silky and glossy.

4. Taste as you go to adjust any seasoning if needed.
