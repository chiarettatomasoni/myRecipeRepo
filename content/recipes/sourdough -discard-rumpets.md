Makes great use of any type of sourdough discard. Can be unfed and straight from the fridge.

Notes: because sourdough varies so much depending on what flour has been used, how it has been fed, how recently it was fed, how sour it is and other factors, the quantities below may need to vary slightly. I suggest you make a small batch following this recipe to start with, and then you can play around with tweaking the quantities slightly for your following batches.

Makes 4 crumpets

You will need crumpet rings for this recipe.

___

Ingredients:

* 225g sourdough starter discard
* 1/2 teaspoon sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon of fine salt
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* rapeseed oil (or any neutral oil with a high smoking point)

___

1. Add all the ingredients to a bowl and mix until a batter as runny as thick double cream forms. This should be pourable and a bit runnier than a pancake batter. If your batter seems too thick, add a teaspoon of water at a time until you are happy with the consistency.

2. I usually taste a small amount of the raw batter - it's not particularly pleasant at this stage, but it gives me a good idea of the sourness of my starter. The batter should have that fermented soury funk to it, but it shouldn't make you pull a funny face when you try it.

3. Heat up a cast iron pan on a medium heat. Cast iron is great for even heat distribution, but any flat bottomed pan will work. Brush the pan and the crumpet rings with oil and place the rings on the pan. Let the rings warm up for 2 minutes to prevent the batter from sticking to them, then pour 2 tablespoons of batter in each of the rings - the rings should be no more than half full.

4. Fry the crumpets for 5 minutes, until the bubbles formed on top all pop and the top looks dry. Then use tongs to flip the crumpet, toast the holey side for 30 seconds and remove from the pan. 

5. Remove from the rings and enjoy straight away, or toast them later. These freeze really well and can be toasted in a toaster straight from frozen.
