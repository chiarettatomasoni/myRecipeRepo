Super moist cake, very easy, pretty

Works with: bergamot (same quantities), clementines (6 rather than 2) and most citrus fruit - adjust quantities to equivalent of 2 medium oranges
Can switch up spices i.e. use ground ginger, cinnamon or star anise

Makes 1 deep 8 inch tin (10 slices)

___

Ingredients:

* 3 whole oranges
* 300g ground almonds, toasted (can use other ground nuts)
* 1 levelled teaspoon of ground cardamom seeds (optional)
* 225g caster sugar plus a tablespoon for sprinkling
* 6 eggs

For the glaze (optional):

either 

* 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade with any bits removed or

or

* 80ml orange juice and 80g caster sugar


___

1. Boil two whole oranges in plenty of water for 2 hours - may need a weight i.e. plate to keep them submerged. Once cooked, drain and blend them really well until a smooth paste forms. If the paste has bits, pass it through a sieve or blend it in batches. Let cool.

2. Preheat an oven to 160C fan or 180C static.

3. Add the almonds to a bowl and mix them with the salt and cardamom, if using. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Whisk the yolks and sugar in a large bowl for at least 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes if using an electric whisk - they should be very pale and fluffy. 
Add a tablespoon of ground almonds and a tablespoon of egg whites into the yolk & sugar mix. Fold these in gently until they are just incorporated, then add a further tablespoon of each, until everything is mixed together into a thick batter.

4. Lightly brush an 8 inch cake tin (best if loose-bottomed) with oil, then line it with baking parchment cut to the right size. The best, neatest way to do this is by using the ***cartouche*** method.

5. Evenly sprinkle a tablespoon of sugar on the bottom of the tin.
Cut the remaining whole orange into really thin rounds - about 2-3mm thick and lay the slices flat on the bottom of the tin. Don't overlap them.  

6. Pour the cake batter on top of the orange slices and bake for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. 

7. Once cooked, remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely in the tin, then use a flat plate to carefully invert the cake and peel the parchment off it. The top of the cake is the side that is decorated with orange slices.

8. To glaze the cake, you can either warm up some orange marmalade in a pan and brush the surface with it, or you can make a simple orange syrup by heating up equal amounts of orange juice and sugar in a pan just until large bubbles form, then remove from the heat and brush on the surface of the cake.
